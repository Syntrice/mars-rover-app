# Mars Rover Application

This Application is being developed to solve a kata-style problem using
test-driven development, while developing a full application. The goal of the
kata is to implement a system which can move "rovers" across the "surface of
mars" according to sequences of commands.

The kata is a task set by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) as part of
their C# / .NET software engineering bootcamp.
